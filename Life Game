Life game is an apllication of CA. The center cell's state depends on the eight cells around.
Here are the game rules:
1.Any living cell will die if the living neighbour is less than 2. It suggests you will die if you are too lonely, having no friends.
2.Any living cell will alive if have 2 or 3 living neghbours around. It suggests you live in an average population world.
3.Any living cell will die if have 3 or more living neighbours. It suggests that you will die if you have a lots of competitors, having no food, waiting to die.
4.Any died cell will alive if have just 3 living neighbours. It suggests the reproduction of humman.
We can easily get it work through C/C++/Python with For-circles and if conditional statement, and I read the code in Excel using VBA, and it is also easy to understand.
We can have different black and white patterns, and found how the cells will be. And I think about the real situation, if there is a river through the map, the survival rate will rise up. The cell's distribution will be totally different.
