# Cellular-Automaton-learning
  I knew CA by accident, believing we can use it well.
  Cellular Automaton is a small and basic model for repetitive computation.
  As if you have a boundary conditions, some rules and you will get a complex model or the values you as you wish.
  Like one-dimensional CA, the main cell's state in the next time, still alive or die, depends on the states of the neighbours, so the stats in the next time will have 265 posibilites.
  I tried to search for the applications of the CA theories, and have found something interesting. No matter the simulation of the migration of population, Boilogical genetic, biomutation, etc, which is derived from the Turing machine.
  Simple rules can build a complex world, computers like this kind of calculating, following the same rules, just repeating. 
  Like No.184 law which can simulate the stream of transportation simply, I wrote a simple code to see if it would work, it is proved that finally the roads will be unobstructed with the cars runnig the same speed after 7 times process, which is accorded with people's common sense. Simple but have a big potential to solve the real system of transportation. And the efficiency of the program is time, and the time is discrete.
  Later I find that we can march on smoothly, but it is difficult to come back, for example I know the prime number in 100, but how to calculate the other prime number using the CA arithmetic, what about the rule, how to decide the initial value.
  After coding, we need decoding. It occurs that maybe we can use the tool we used to use in Digital Circuits, the Karnaugh Map. I always believe that why we should simplify the complex procedure of questions, because everything have principles. Through it, we can find the basic factor of the substance and help people understand the similar things.
  I'm a green hand in this strange field, and I will be glad to share my ideas and learn more about the computation with the help of Mathmatics, MatLab or Python.
